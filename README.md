Libft (Library of Functions)

In this project, you will be creating a library of functions, the file structure for this project is the following:

.c Files

Where all of your functions will be written in.

.h (Header)

Your header file is useful for 2 things:

First, instead of doing for example `#include <unistd.h>` in all of your .c files, you just write it once in your header and all of your .c files will read it from your header file.

Secondly, let's say one of your .c files uses another function from another .c file, well instead of writting that function above, just write `#include "libft.h"` and it will find it in your header file.

Make sure you add #include "libft.h" in all of your .c files.

Makefile

Makefile is where you will create a file to compile your projects. Remember how in the piscine, you created an int main and gcc to compile the projects, well with a Makefile, you don't have to do that anymore, you just type make once you have created your Makefile.


## Installing and Compiling Fract-ol

`ft_isascii` - checks whether c fits into the ASCII character set.

`ft_isprint` - checks for any printable character.

`ft_toupper` - convert char to uppercase.

`ft_tolower`  - convert char to lowercase.

Functions from <string.h>

`ft_memset` - fill memory with a constant byte.

`ft_strlen` - calculate the length of a string.

`ft_bzero` - zero a byte string.

`ft_memcpy` - copy memory area.

`ft_memmove` - copy memory area.

`ft_strlcpy` - copy string to an specific size.

`ft_strlcat` - concatenate string to an specific size.

`ft_strchr` - locate character in string.

`ft_strrchr` - locate character in string.

`ft_strncmp` - compare two strings.

`ft_memchr` - scan memory for a character.

`ft_memcmp` - compare memory areas.

`ft_strnstr` - locate a substring in a string.

`ft_strdup` - creates a dupplicate for the string passed as parameter.


Functions from <stdlib.h>

`ft_atoi` - convert a string to an integer.

`ft_calloc` - allocates memory and sets its bytes' values to 0.

Non-standard functions

`ft_substr` - returns a substring from a string.

`ft_strjoin` - concatenates two strings.

`ft_strtrim` - trims the beginning and end of string with specific set of chars.

`ft_split` - splits a string using a char as parameter.

`ft_itoa` - converts a number into a string.

`ft_strmapi` - applies a function to each character of a string.

`ft_striteri` - applies a function to each character of a string.

`ft_putchar_fd` - output a char to a file descriptor.

`ft_putstr_fd` - output a string to a file descriptor.

`ft_putendl_fd` - output a string to a file descriptor, followed by a new line.

`ft_putnbr_fd` - output a number to a file descriptor.


Linked list functions

`ft_lstnew` - creates a new list element.

`ft_lstadd_front` - adds an element at the beginning of a list.

`ft_lstsize` - counts the number of elements in a list.

`ft_lstlast` - returns the last element of the list.

`ft_lstadd_back` - adds an element at the end of a list.

`ft_lstclear` - deletes and free list.

`ft_lstiter` - applies a function to each element of a list.

`ft_lstmap` - applies a function to each element of a list.
